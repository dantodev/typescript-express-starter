# Typescript/Express.js Starter

This my Typescript/Express.js starter setup with:

- Typescript (using `ts-node`)
- Express.js as web server
- Jest for unit tests
- ESLint + Prettier for syntax linting and consistent code style
- VS Code format on save configuration (requires the ESLint plugin in VS Code)
- GIT hook to lint code before commit
- nodemon for automatic restart on crash and watch mode while development
- dotenv environment configurations
- error handling and reusable error type exception
- simple CLI logger with log level support

**This is tuned to my current needs but I'm open for recommendations if you think I'm doing something wrong.**
